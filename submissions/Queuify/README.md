**Name**: Queuify

**Description**: What is this app? How does it help you? What problem does it solve for you and your friends?
Queuify is a iOS app where users can join a digital queue. This allows people to move through a line without 
physically being in the queue, allowing them to do other activites simultaneously. Users can save and enjoy 
more time during holidays/trips. I was inspired to create this app after a recent vacation to Italy where my 
family and I had to queue 4 hours to get tickets for a museum (Vatican). I believe that publishing Queuify will 
save time and make everyone's lives more fun!

**How did you build this**:
This was the first time I developed an app and the first time I used Swift programming language. In the
beginning I spent a lot of time watching Youtube videos to learn the language and structure of SwiftUI. 
I originally used the Swift Playgrounds app on my ipad before transfering my project to Xcode on a school Mac. 

**How many hours did you spend on this**: 40+ hours 

**Did you use #arcade to log your progress?**: Yes but only at the end
